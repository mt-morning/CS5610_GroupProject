# Summary:
This is the final project I worked on with two of my classmates for CS5610: Web Development at Northeastern University. The intended outcome of the project was to apply the MERN stack as we learnt it from Vasan Subramanian's Pro MERN Stack, our main source of coursework. We decided to build an inventory management system with an option to expand it towards order management and integration with Square. At the end of the project, we learned more about using various React libraries, building data schemas with GraphQL and MongoDB, debugging, and deploying our website with Heroku and Atlas.
